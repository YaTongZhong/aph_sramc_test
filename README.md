# aph_sramc_test
it it a sram controller on ahb bus.
there are some file which cannot be obtained,so we just modify part of verilog files.
we need to write dut ,which convert aph signal to sram controlling signal.
we also need to write testcase,if needed, to verify our design
# if you want to study ahb bus,I can provide some videos for you .
